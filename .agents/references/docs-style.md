# Docs Style

## Docs (packages/docs)
- Friendly, concise, instructional developer-doc tone.
- Short declarative sentences, light imperative phrasing, minimal context, optimized for skimming.
- Keep it approachable but not chatty.
- Prefer 1-2 sentences per paragraph and one idea per paragraph.
- Use active voice when possible.
- Start sections with a short purpose line when it helps orientation.
- Use backticks for API names, props, events, and code identifiers.
- Prefer internal links; use external links only when no internal reference exists.
- Avoid repeating content across pages; link instead.
- Keep headings short and free of trailing punctuation.
- Use minimal, concept-focused snippets and avoid unrelated boilerplate.
- Use `code-group` only when showing multiple variants.
- Use VitePress line highlighting to emphasize relevant lines; use diff markers only when explaining incremental changes.
- Keep related snippets consistent in naming, data shapes, and structure.
- For Vue examples, prefer `<script setup lang="ts">` and Composition API unless the surrounding page already uses a different pattern.
